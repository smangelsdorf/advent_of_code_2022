# Advent of Code 2022

I might do Advent of Code this year. I've never committed to it before.

If you want to avoid spoilers, don't read my solutions until you've attempted it
yourself. If I don't end up pushing any solutions here, it's because I'm
helping you avoid spoilers, and definitely not laziness.

## License

For whatever it's worth, this is all licensed under the
[MIT license](LICENSE.txt), just because I hate public code that doesn't spell
out license terms.
