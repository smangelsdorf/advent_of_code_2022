# Advent of Code 2022

My Advent of Code solutions for 2022.

I did this to improve my Rust skills, learned a few cool things along the way
about graph traversal, pathfinding, spatial data, and optimisation in Rust.

A few of the solutions aren't perfect, but I got all the stars, so I'm happy.

For whatever it's worth, this is all licensed under the

out license terms.
